Almost everything has sugar nowadays and its hilarious what we have made society so vulnerable to the taste of it. I had numerously told in various blogs / vlogs how sugar is causing obesity and diabetes but I haven’t really explained the science behind it. Caveat: I’m not a medical personnel and take my advice with precaution. My goals in sharing my thoughts about Keto is to share knowledge that I have applied for myself and known to work four months in to the diet. Sugar basically is not a very good power source for our brain - of which is the most energy intensive part of our body. Overeating creates an alteration to our neurological reward system and throwing errors all over the place thus creating sugar addiction. It is so common. Why I say this? whenever I talk to people about the reasons why I’m doing the ketogenic diet - most tend to sway off, not listen or contradict… of which I do understand that the addiction is more stronger than lending another person an ear to hear out another way of living.

Our species branched out from a common ancestral line as the bonobos 200,000 years ago. From that point, we started to learn organized hunting, eating bone marrow and mastering the art of fire until we discovered organized farming 12,000 years ago. Doing the math: 12,000 / 200,000 = .06 or 6%. What does this equation mean? it means that for 94% of the time, we have been consuming fats and meat through hunting and foraging. There are also earlier discoveries of our species where in we have been categorized as smashing mamoth bones - for bone marrow as it is also believed that this caused our neurocortex to be more developed than most species. This concept is fairly hard to understand for most but I this theory though unproven as no one can go back in the past makes sense since it fits the concept of natural selection - which I believe is the overarching code of the universe and runs in the background..","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":1460},"end":{"line":6,"column":926,"offset":2385}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":1460},"end":{"line":6,"column":926,"offset":2385}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The benefits of Keto is unprecedented to my surge of creativity and cognitive function.
