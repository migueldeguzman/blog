I try to model his way of thinking a lot but yeah it is rather hard to mimic someone who I believe to have a genetic mutation. </p>\n<p>I wish to work for this guy in the future, the future where he is converging humanity to reach for the stars..</p>\n<p>PS. Obviously I could write a lot more info about Elon - maybe in the future, yet I would keep this blog open to like savor the moment where humanity was blessed with the mind and heart of probably will end up as the most important person in history ever.</p>"}
