It makes one understand the world better. The ability to code in javascript have given me a new way of interpreting information in a cause and effect manner. We define the arguments then we put it in code so it can review if your arguments are acceptable by a certain filter that is predetermined by engines hooked in our browsers called JIT compilers then accepts the code so you can make the web do what you want - literally. How cool is that!!! The ability to create interfaces that interacts with data from people using your websites or the ability to design colors, shapes and effects to the finest details… that is what web coding do…or most computer languages does.
