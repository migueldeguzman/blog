I see things in how our human mind works while factoring the physical boundaries of a certain problem and also applying binary logic to it. I mirrored this perspective from Elon Musk. This process goes deep sometimes. I’ll give an example. Climate change and plastics have baffled me from my stint in Palawan as garbage was all over the string of islands of Linapacan during the months of June to September including the bleaching of corals. Undertstanding this problem needs a fair amount of technical knowledge. The jetstream is the wind channel where most of our climate is highly dependent upon, the garbage patches all around the world are also being directed by this. The impact of the arctic region and the amount of sea ice it creates to give a cooling effect in our atmosphere while also reflecting the sunlight back to space is decreasing. The sun’s power to constantly bombard our planet with lightwaves is a constant. We still continue to charge our atmosphere of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. It is not because we don’t have the technology to not to do so…but rather excruciatingly painful fact to accept is the amount of people who still need cheap (from an economic standpoint) power most especially less fortunate countries are still tremendously high. How can we just tell them to stop? Is it more rationale to improve the lives of all people all around the world so we can focus as a species to tackle the ambitious re-energification of the world…? It goes deep. So deep that I really do not have the solution to how complex of a problem it is.

What do I mean by extreme patience? well I believe my mom (nanay in Filipino) provided me with an embeded genetic structure to endure worthwhile pain and appreciate sacrifices along the way. This blog is a particularly good example. The art I created and used in this post was done for two and a half hours. I took a forty five minute (10 kms) in between just to go to a really cool location (Camana Bay) just to write a fairly long technical post. Upon finishing the project and entering the last code on the commandline, it didn’t posted…apparently the public wifi doesn’t allow git push to Github servers so I ended have going home in the heat of tropical noon. I started 7am and finshed 2pm..  I believe most will not do this as it takes tremendous effort just to understand what I have just said. I’m patient enough to create with no particularly direct positive result. I do it even though I make grammatical mistakes over most of my write-ups.
