Our species branched out from a common ancestral line as the bonobos 200,000 years ago. From that point, we started to learn organized hunting, eating bone marrow and mastering the art of fire until we discovered organized farming 12,000 years ago. Doing the math: 12,000 / 200,000 = .06 or 6%. What does this equation mean? it means that for 94% of the time, we have been consuming fats and meat through hunting and foraging. There are also earlier discoveries of our species where in we have been categorized as smashing mamoth bones - for bone marrow as it is also believed that this caused our neurocortex to be more developed than most species. This concept is fairly hard to understand for most but I have reflected to this concept (though unproven as no one can go back in the past) but makes sense since it fits the concept of natural selection and early human evidences. // needs referrences..","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":768},"end":{"line":8,"column":914,"offset":1681}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":768},"end":{"line":8,"column":914,"offset":1681}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The benefits of Keto is unprecedented to my surge of creativity and cognitive function.
