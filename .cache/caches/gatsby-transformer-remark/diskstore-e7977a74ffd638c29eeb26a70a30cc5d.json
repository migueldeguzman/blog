As the world now gears to becoming more cybernetic - the concept of education, profession and jobs consequently will change big time. Like for most of history, people are unaware of how us humans figure it out over the past two hundred thousand years. We first became hunter gatherers, then shamans, then farmers, some are priests but most went to war as soldiers or seafarers in concquests, factory workers when we discovered the power of steam engines, became office employees to support the growing need to rebuild countries after two world wars and now we are creating intelligent machines as computer coders. I guess the fundamental concept of work should be “continues learning” since we are so adaptive to the ever changing needs of our society. One must accept that we are not confined in one system of productivity and peek out into the unkown and discover ourselves.","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":36,"offset":852},"end":{"line":8,"column":1140,"offset":1956},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":3,"offset":819},"end":{"line":8,"column":1140,"offset":1956},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":817},"end":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":1958},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"listItem","loose":false,"checked":null,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Our ability to understand nature and the universe","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":5,"offset":1964},"end":{"line":10,"column":54,"offset":2013},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":3,"offset":1962},"end":{"line":10,"column":56,"offset":2015},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" - most never had the chance to  ","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":56,"offset":2015},"end":{"line":10,"column":89,"offset":2048},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":3,"offset":1962},"end":{"line":10,"column":89,"offset":2048},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":1960},"end":{"line":10,"column":89,"offset":2048},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":381},"end":{"line":10,"column":89,"offset":2048},"indent":[1,1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":10,"column":89,"offset":2048}}}}
