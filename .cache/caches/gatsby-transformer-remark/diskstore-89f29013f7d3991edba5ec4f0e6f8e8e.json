It causes us to test our fragile time in this world as we cannot control everything. I truly tried my best (for the past two years) to establish myself and work by my own terms but I ultimately reached to this conclusion, I need to go back to working in the accounting and finance profession. </p>\n<p>Reasons are simple. Financial considerations. But I am excited to work again not because of that. I am looking forward to meet new people and experiences in other countries. Totally different from my perspectives when I first traveled and work in West Africa and Dubai where I chase money.</p>\n<p>I really need funds to set up my projects (yes! coding still continues..). It is very difficult to pitch people to invest in projects that are poorly established in form and credibility. They need tangible and verifiable solutions to problems and that is a thing I’m still figuring out.</p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to update this blog for where I’ll set-up shop..The projects will continue. This are just bumps in the road.. Just need to get resources.</p>"}
