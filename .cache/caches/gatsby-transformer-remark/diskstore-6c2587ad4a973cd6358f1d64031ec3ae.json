Small snippets of codes that I call “bots”. Bots are all over our smartphones through notifications, handling our credit card information, chats to our best friends… it’s just the gifts of tech where we are in a time where moore’s law is being maximized more and more - even me an accountant have deep dived this unprecedented opportunity of our times to code solutions for some routinary computerized tasks and make art just like this blog.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":355},"end":{"line":4,"column":675,"offset":1029}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":355},"end":{"line":4,"column":675,"offset":1029}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What I’m contemplating always about bots is it’s asynchronous capabilities - those that run in the background of what you see in the GUI (graphical user interface) of any device or platform your using. This type of codes are doing stuff that do not reveal themselves to ordinary users. A good example for this is what have happened to last US elections where Russia paid alot of ads through facebook just to push Trump’s campaign. How futile that another nation can invest in chaotic information because we do now have the tech to do such. Insidous at it may sound, bots are worth contemplating but it’s just so hard to defend ourselves over it. I did shutdown my social media platforms but still I use amazon who uses my purchase data and information. Google is feeding itself all of our searches where we are powering it to create better suggestions while having access to all our data.
