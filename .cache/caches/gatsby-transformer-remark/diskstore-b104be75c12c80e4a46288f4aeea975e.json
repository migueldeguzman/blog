Our species branched out from a common ancestral line as the bonobos 200,000 years ago. From that point, we started to learn organized hunting, eating bone marrow and mastering the art of fire until we discovered organized farming 12,000 years ago. Doing the math: 12,000 / 200,000 = .06 or 6%. What does this equation mean? it means that for 94% of the time, we have been consuming fats and meat through hunting and foraging. There are also earlier discoveries of our species where in we have been categorized as smashing mamoth bones - for bone marrow as it is also believed that this caused our neurocortex to be more developed than most species, making us the alpha in the present times.","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":768},"end":{"line":8,"column":703,"offset":1470}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":768},"end":{"line":8,"column":703,"offset":1470}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":1474}}}}
