This type of codes are doing stuff that do not reveal themselves to ordinary users. A good example for this is what have happened to last US elections where Russia paid alot of ads through facebook just to push Trump’s campaign. How futile that another nation can invest in chaotic information because we do now have the tech to do such. Insidous at it may sound, bots are worth contemplating but it’s just so hard to defend ourselves over it. I did shutdown my social media platforms but still I use amazon who uses my purchase data and information.
