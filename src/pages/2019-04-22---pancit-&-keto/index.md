My body literally runs on ketones now. How did I find out? My housemate gave me a bowl of Pancit which is a famous rice noodles in the Philippines. 

I vomitted and went to the bathroom after an hour. 

The intensity of carbohydrates in the noodle strands, soy sauce & oyster sauce knocked me with a whole day of headache. It felt like I was poisoned. 

I should be more careful now of what I eat.
