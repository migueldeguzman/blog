***Purchasing a domain for my blog...***

Domains I've purchased in the past:

* navotac.com
* astronucleus.com (still owned)
* myepictraveladventures.com
* migueldeguzman.com
* two more that I forgot what the names are....(when I was in Dubai)


To be honest, maintaining the "github" word in my domain is very beneficial for me as many coders / companies recognize that my blog is hosted in the most widely used open source repository in the world of which have garnered me two offers in the past two months without me applying for a job. 

But I guess its about time to put a proper brand for my blog and purchasing a domain is the best start. The values that a reader may get from the concepts that I write is priceless in my honest opinion. It serves justice to get the domain name [tech-stoic.com](https://tech-stoic.com/)

Experiments I'm currently doing:
* vlogging to fifteen episodes now - my youtube channel is [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSvsJZz6MztOXu_UE9tk7lw?view_as=subscriber).
* morning calisthenics (instead of the evening,  where it affects a bit of my sleep)
* sleep using binaural music
* still on keto
* cooking - a requirement your on a ketogenic diet
* the book I'm writing...[astronucleus](https://www.notion.so/astronucleus/Astronucleus-from-cells-to-the-stars-a90798d5ed1e4ca0b679e43040f08371)
* this blog. A copy of my brain.
* volunteering with caymaneco.org
* volunteering for the [kevinrichardsonfoundation](https://kevinrichardsonfoundation.org/)?
* [codingfortheenvironment](https://codingfortheenvironment-2554445342.gtsb.io/)
* stoicism (very hard to apply modern society..)
* maintaining a low resting heartbeat per minute..(through cycling..)
* reading more on depth psychology - focusing on my recycled book copy of Erich Neuman's "The origins and history of conciousness"


Upon purchase of the domain.... this means I need to edit all tags that I have made in the last 99 blogs that I did. I'll have to do this after my gun session, ow should add recreational shooting in the list above!!!!

Update 12/03/2019 - needed to request a cancellation and refund from domain.com because the service is not great as it is 6 days already into the purchase and my domain is still not fully activated. I was really frustrated as the customer support got me going into cirles..I might have to go back to godaddy again.
