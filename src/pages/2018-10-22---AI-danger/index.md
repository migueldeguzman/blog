I stumbled in two interviews of Joe Rogan with Elon Musk and Sam Harris about Artificial Intelligence. It scared the hell out of my imaginative thinking..

Elon Musk warned the US congress and former president Obama over the issue as it should be regulated because of its potential to destroy the humanity. Elon Musk further stressed that a super intelligent computer system can spread misinformation or create scenarios just to alter votes or improve market prices of shares. 

Sam Harris shares the same analogy and he stresses that if there will be a company like google or facebook that will be able to create an ai system that can improve or change itself or other computer programs and produce productivity at the cost of raw materials *(Product = Raw Material + Overhead instead of Finished Goods = Raw Material + Labor + Overhead)* Russia or China won't hesitate to fly nuclear rockets to Silicon Valley and would trigger chaos.. They will not wait till incumbent Trump gets to decide on such power.

Most would think that they are insane but I do understand when a genie is out of the box, there is no point of turning back. A super intelligent computer system is capable of computing 20,000 years worth of human operation in a week. It is impossible to stop machines as thinking as fast as electricity and has access to the world's information and technological resources.. 

> It's alarming that the whole world is not acting on monitoring the progress of artificial intelligence. We just let google and social media platforms mine our searches, likes and posts for the purpose of building their AI systems.
Human nature tends to ignore something they do not understand, like what is happening to our climate and its current state (another blog to expand this..).

If you wish to read on this and educate yourself further..

Read [Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom](https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/1501227742). A tough read but full of information dedicated to AI..

And..

These two videos can explain further and better..
