***Life in Cayman Islands is an amazing opportunity*** 

I try not to post how great of a place Cayman is for me for a vareity of reasons. I just don't want to boast the idea of how lucky I am to have gotten a chance to work in one of the safest and most financially stable places on spaceship earth. 

The opportunity to be situated in a place where I could code, experiment, get healthy and study a lot of truths, learn music and plan for the future and beyond is something I'm so grateful for.

This week has been work and a little bit of preparing for the weekend as we are to celebrate this month. Me, Styner and Kuya Pacho will be very busy this Saturday and will be with close friends in the island. Looking forward for the weekend.

Normal topics will resume on Monday...
