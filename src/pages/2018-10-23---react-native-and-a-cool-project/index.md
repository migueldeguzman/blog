Just a quick update...

I found myself an intense and worthy challenge of creating a really useful android app that can help manage climate change. That is why I will learn react native for building apps in the android echo system.

This probably is the toughest challenge (yet!, no idea of how react native works, excited and anxious..) 

I will also blog its progress...so stay tuned?
