***I'm kind of obsessed with maximizing time lately, especially after my dear friend Mags passed away..and this week was focused on reflecting a lot about how this year went..***

Just a short blog on how grateful I am despite the risks I took for the past years. I am able to recover from adversities, have a bed to sleep, a computer to write this blog nd a smartphone to make amazing sketches about my brain ticks. All of my cup of time were poured to learning and non-stop cycling this year. Health is at its peak. Resources growing. Nothing to complain really. That is why I consider 2019 is the best year to-date. 

I have built habits in 2019 that will enable me a better platform to tackling bigger challenges next year. I believe 2020 will be a bigger year in itself. More opportunities to create stories, art and [vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSvsJZz6MztOXu_UE9tk7lw?disable_polymer=true). I'm dedicating more time now to learn code like I used to do in 2018. Yes, more psychology and neuroscience! I just finished [Dr. Peterson's personality course](https://courses.jordanbpeterson.com/personality) last week. Yeah, very optimistic for the coming year...pretty excited. 

I just have to focus on doing the essential - the choices that enables me to make more choices. This will be an ongoing layer of frame for reviewing my decisions. I want to use 2020 to analyze what I can improve more and invest more effort, resources and time to cultivate it. 

PS. I should be also aiming to improve the quality of content that I'm putting out in the interweb and get better with aiming a pistol during practices, great that they're open today ^_^.
