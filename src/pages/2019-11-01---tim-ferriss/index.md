***The [4-hour-workweek](https://fourhourworkweek.com/) - four years after reading this book and I have visited places where most people from my country will never ever cross in his/her lifetime, met the most amazing and wonderful people and more importantly created answers to the most important questions the universe has to offer..***

I literally tried to mimic this guy, [Timothy Ferriss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ferriss). Unfortunately, I failed. But not because his strategy never works, kid me not it worked for a lot of people around the world and have created a movement of jobs, resources and ideas around the world. I think ultimately I failed because I tried the parts of the books that never will work for my case. I still will recommend the book due to its profound rules that anyone can apply as a whole to his or her own path across life. 

Tim believes that time is the most important resource, retirement should be a fuel and not a goal, understand your fear and automate your life. I do apply the idea of putting decisions asleep while thinking somebody is pointing a gun in your forehead. This thinking kept me alive for three years even though it is another forced version of always telling the truth no matter what is the cost. Reality is so hard to grasp, even much harder in the times that we had as the modern age makes us drool almost sixteen hours a day in all of these devices and work we have to do. 

I was watching Tim again last week and found myself re-learning again one of his most important lessons - the focus to ask the right questions, asking great questions. This is another version how to discover the truth but requires more energy and knowledge as the deep layers of information where reality rests is somewhat not self-evident. We need to think harder and dig deeper through asking the proper questions. It is so important that becoming lost in the myriads of semi-sensible and non-sensible information is so prevalent and somewhat makes one addictive because of the internet.

This is an amazing ride across life, I had immense highs and lows in the process and reality keeps changing and evolving - and reading Tim's books, listening to his [podcasts]() and building from his take on stoicism - for he is whom I mimic the practice of stoicism as an operating system for life is part of the layers and layers of thinkers that are worth digging into. Tim Ferriss, I will always will be grateful to learn from your books, experiments and lessons of life.
