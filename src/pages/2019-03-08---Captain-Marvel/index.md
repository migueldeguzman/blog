Just a short movie review.

I actually liked the whole movie. Brie Larson played the role pretty well. I thought that the movie will lack a strong story line but I was wrong. It packs a punch on its own, made me think about what I have read back in the days about the *Skrulls*. Great ending as well. Can't wait for Avengers: Endgame.

Shoutout to my friend Jeff and Princess Manalo for treating me on this one!
