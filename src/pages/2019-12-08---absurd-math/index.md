***There is so much that we can measure and so much can't with our current sciences. Below are some of the topics I've came across in the past year or so that makes me think what reality really is because of the large amounts of questions and data involved..***

* Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Just the thought everything physics can only explain as "mass" to this date is approximately only 4.9% of the universe...is utterly fascinating and discomforting some time.

* Consciousness - We are utterly fascinating biological machines able to create so much with our mind and hands. The crazy thing is we do not know how our brain utilizes information. This truth made me visualize a lot as I do know how computers record stuff and translates them. The big difference is the amount of electricity that runs into a computing machine compared to us. Our is just very low energy and that makes our neurons so bloody fascinating.

* Deep time - Technically we could measure this but we are unable to comprehend the abusrdity of time if taken into account from the birth of the universe to the far future. It's immense amount of uncertainty and entanglement to tons of information and I have no words to put to it..

* The Butterfly Effect - Even a seemingly unimportant tweak in any decision we choose takes us in to a far more different outcome that we are incapable of predicting. What is weird is we can see a pattern of it as (simulated by researchers) showing an image of a butterfly. 

* The future of artificial intelligence - We are in a transition point in history that the computing power of machines are increasing and it changes the fabric of society - the way we travel, communicate, think or consume..

* Natural Selection - it is another thing that is utterly powerful of a concept and we are unable to measure with. There is so much that biology, deep time and physics was able to provide as building blocks for how modern our society is but the pursuit to measure its relation to how darwinian theory will have the same effects in the future will be futile. 

It is so absurd that the premise that the universe we live in and its expanse is hard to comprehend because of the numbers and data that it has all over...and knowing that I will never have enough time in this world to comprehend such...makes me more grateful in a way that at least I get to touch this concepts√ü in this blog.
