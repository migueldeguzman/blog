***We (me and Koz) are trying to make a band here in Cayman Islands:***

- *The Tilers!!!* 
- *The Invoices!!!* 
- *The Wire Transfers!!!*

*Unfortunately, I'm still learning to play the guitar but just needs a lot of practice as Koz tells me a lot. Can't wait to tackle a lot of challenges along the way..*

*But what interests me the most to learn how to play the guitar is biology or the biological capabilities of our body to adapt. The ability to sing and play music is a remarkable feat to achieve genetically. Encoding through practicing every single free moment that I have is so hard. Developing the discipline to maintain the habit needs extraordinary focus on myself.*

*Blogging might be a great way to force myself to learn a bunch of cool stuff for music.. I'll try to experiment sharing on this topic every week, every thursday perhaps..*
