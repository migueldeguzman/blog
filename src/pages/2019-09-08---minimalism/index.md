***Everything should be black and sweat proof..*** 

Well nothing in Cayman is sweat proof but I like to think less so I minimize the number of items I own and the color variation of my aparrel. Black is almost all of my gear - makes it much simpler to think of what to wear and less options means less need to make complex decisions on what to wear of which a decision we make every single day. 

I had challenged myself to a minimalistic lifestyle since I did my backpacking trip in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia for three months and up to my stay in Palawan for more than a year. Less is more, less things to own - more room to think plus more money saved over the long run. Buy only when necessity is at stake of which again leaves more room to think. Less time to think about our daily habits gives us more control over our time that we can spend on what matters most. 

Another shortblog but important. Again, less is so much more..
