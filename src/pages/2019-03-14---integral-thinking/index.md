I truly believe that common sense is not common for most of us. You'll often get the impression from my blogs that I see most people as zombies..that is because I really do. A lot of us have become reactive to ideas, opinions or emotions without filtering the such first. I was like this before as well and it is not good. Rarely that I find people that thinks first how a certain topic originated first before making a response. 

I'll try to put each of these significant events that I have encountered in groups in order to map where in our human capacity we acquire a certain trait or physical attribute - forcing our adaptation in the process. Post-modern category is a little bit tricky because we still don't know much of how most of these concepts will affect our evolution in the future.

Whatever we do, use or say in this world... has a history so intricate that everyone I believe should atleast educate themselves in order to navigate our daily struggles. I'll keep updating this blog as I think there is much to add in this list.
