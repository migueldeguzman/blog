First, we have the lizard brain or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system\">limbic system</a> where in we acquired after branching out from the reptilian cluster millions of years ago. Primordial in nature, it handles the coding of new neurons when we do exercises and autonomously run our our basic motor functions as well as let us react to fight or flight situations much faster than our <a href=\"\">cerebral cortex</a> can process. This is why we can avoid accidents or react better during close calls (I have done this a lot while cycling in Cayman Islands and travelling parts of South East Asia) without us even comprehending what is happening. The cortices play a huge role in our learning, focus, perception, awareness, tought, memory and consciousness. Why I’m going complex on this? I’m sharing vital information that explain that our brain is composed of ancient mechanisms that we do not choose to make or rather we are born with the most complex thing in the entire universe. Most people without a good understanding of the science of how our mind works is most likely to fall short of their potential. Our brain is so ancient that inside it resides the ability to connect our emotions to what we do may it be good or bad. </p>\n<p>Yes! we are wired to do bad things too. I bet no one in this world who have not done anything bad to another life form - may it be animals, plants or other people. Most of the time we hurt the ones we so love. It is rather unfortunate and so depressing to admit that the people in the holocaust that shoot pregnant women at the back of their head are also of our species - they are also humans obviously.</p>\n<p>That is the point of the skill - embodiement of the shadow. As we navigate the world, we are always exposed to myriads of complex problems normally associating people to be dull or fall short of their responses to situations.</p>\n<p>To combat monsters, one must become a monster and control themselves - perfectly aligned to stoic phoilosophy (the core operating system for life that I apply…more on <a href=\"https://tech-stoic.github.io/stoicism/\">stoicism</a>.)</p>","excerpt":"Geralt of Rivia! one of the best characters in a video game I have ever played, namely -  Wither 3: The Wild Hunt in PS4 .
