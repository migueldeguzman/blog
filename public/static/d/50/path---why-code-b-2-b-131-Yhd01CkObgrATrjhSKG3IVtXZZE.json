It makes one understand the world better. The ability to code in javascript have given me a new way of interpreting information in a cause and effect manner. We define the arguments then we put it in code so it can review if your arguments are acceptable by a certain filter that is predetermined by engines hooked in our browsers called JIT compilers then accepts the code so you can make the web do what you want - literally. How cool is that!!! The ability to create interfaces that interacts with data from people using your websites or the ability to design colors, shapes and effects to the finest details… that is what web coding do…or most computer languages does. </p>\n<p>Learning code gave me a better understanding of how things work, especially truths that have plagued me to understand since I was young. My brother use to tell me that there are codes running in our veins that are so ancient and it only since I learn proper coding that made sense that biology is in a way a coding mechanism through DNA. No wonder we’re coding a lot of ills like diabetes through sugar, lung cancer through cigarettes and fossil fuel exhausts or obesity through over consumption and lack of routinary exercise. </p>\n<p>Thoughts encode too… I had this plague in my brain that I hated my dad for making my brother in-operable in the real world after making a big mistake. This threw a bug in my head that “Why do I have to pick up the slack for the family being the youngest?” It is only being recently that I understood that that words somewhat altered my thinking and other thoughts like acceptance and resilience. </p>","excerpt":"This post is dedicated to my friends namely “Latakz” (somewhat means “residue” in tagalog / filipino language)..
