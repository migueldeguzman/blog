Natural selection at depth is a ridiculous formula - trying to occupy each open gaps in the DNA whenever it’s possible this contradicts my first understanding of it that evolution is forced by what nature gives us…now we - humans are a product of the most robust random code ever built - running for the last 3.2 billion years starting from basic carbon, oxygen, phosporus and nitrogen.</em></p>\n<p><em>Everything fits well on the statement I described above. Chemistry includes the study of the four elements of life and natural selection uses a lot of biology, physics and genetics. Computer coding explains well how can bits of basic letters can create the blog you are reading now or the diagram I illustrated. DNA and RNAs also follow the same flow of thinking - tiny bits of biological code create fetuses that turns into adults. Neuroscience fits well with evolution in explaining how the development of brain came about including a deeper understanding of our human nature which is a big topic of psychology and primatology.</em></p>\n<p>*The stoics preaches to focus on what you can control - and always it will be is your mind, health and response. The mind is a collection of what we put - if you put garbage ideas, you clearly end up with garbage ideas. This is the reason why 90% of the time I always listen to good music, audiobooks and intellectual podcasts rather than sticking to low-resolution conversations or talking to much. People think I talk a lot but I would argue that I listen more than I speak. *</p>","excerpt":"Stoic philosophy is great base layer for understanding complex concepts..
