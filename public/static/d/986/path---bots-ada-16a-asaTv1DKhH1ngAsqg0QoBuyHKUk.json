I am currently now tackling a project for my boss that does that. It solves a few headaches for customers and the team  plus allowing computers to do this simple but repititive jobs gives me more time to focus on the right problems to solve.</p>\n<p>I want to emphasize in this post that this project is rather composed of less than a megabyte of data to complete with a fair bit amount of time to construct the logic and extensive testing plus coordination to proper departments. Small snippets of codes that I call “bots”. Bots are all over our smartphones through notifications, handling our credit card information, chats to our best friends… it’s just the gifts of tech where we are in a time where moore’s law is being maximized more and more - even me an accountant have deep dived this unprecedented opportunity of our times to code solutions for some routinary computerized tasks and make art just like this blog.</p>\n<p>What I’m contemplating always about code is the “asynchronous nature of codes” - those that run in the background of what you see in the GUI (graphical user interface) of any device or platform your using. This type of codes are doing stuff that do not reveal themselves to ordinary users. A good example for this is what have happened to last US elections where Russia paid alot of ads through facebook just to push Trump’s campaign. How futile that another nation can invest in chaotic information because we do now have the tech to do such. Insidous at it may sound, bots are worth contemplating but it’s just so hard to defend ourselves over it. I did shutdown my social media platforms but still I use amazon who uses my purchase data and information. Google is feeding itself all of our searches where we are powering it to create better suggestions while having access to all our data. It gets creepy as to how this tech giants have power over all of our information - literally.</p>\n<p>I do sound an alarmist here but this is just the reality of this mega experiment that is folding our minds to places we have not , still unfolding its pages at a very rapid phase -probably at lightspeed so our brains even combined at this state of our evolution won’t be able to comprehend what all of these codes are doing.
