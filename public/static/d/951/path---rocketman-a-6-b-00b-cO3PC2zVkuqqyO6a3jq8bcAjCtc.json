Natural selection at depth is a ridiculous formula - trying to occupy each open gaps in the DNA whenever it’s possible this contradicts my first understanding of it that evolution is forced by what nature gives us…now we - humans are a product of the most robust random code ever built - running for the last 3.2 billion years starting from basic carbon, oxygen, phosporus and nitrogen.</em></p>\n<p><em>Everything fits well on the statement I described above. Chemistry includes the study of the four elements of life and natural selection uses a lot of biology, physics and genetics. Computer coding explains well how can bits of basic letters can create the blog you are reading now or the diagram I illustrated. DNA and RNAs also follow the same flow of thinking - tiny bits of biological code create fetuses that turns into adults. Neuroscience fits well with evolution in explaining how the development of brain came about including a deeper understanding of our human nature which is a big topic of psychology and primatology.</em></p>\n<p><em>The stoics focuses on what you can control and always it will be are your mind, body and response. The mind is a collection of what we put - if you put garbage ideas, you clearly end up with garbage ideas. It is much easier to put concepts in our head where most of them are like puzzle pieces that fits in their own peculiar way, clearly mesh themselves to strengthen each other. I found the synergy of the ideas align with stoicism - as most truths that we do not know must be understood properly and be communicated in a way that it doesn’t harm another life form.</em></p>\n<p><em>What I’m trying to convey as a message here is the truths of the world mesh together, lies degenerate our life. If you ground your life in some kind of lie, it will clearly decompose either through some blistering speed of doom or the more hurtful way is gradual decay of health or unlived time. Often times this is regret on the deathbed or old age. Most are mired with strangling relationships, social media, video games or drugs (including alcohol.) - the average people think they are in control wherein they are not. Its becoming a rant of a blog now but I guess I’ll take it rather than lying to myself.</em></p>","excerpt":"Starhopper successfully did 150 meters flight vertically and returned to the ground in 57 seconds! \n Currently at lecture 4 of Dr. Sapolsky…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/creating-art/","/tags/people/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rocketman","tags":["creating-art","people","blog"],"date":"August 26, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/rocketman/"}}
