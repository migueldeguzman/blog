He’s really supportive and wants everybody to enjoy the process. Though I expect myself to be serious on learning the skill of pistol shooting, I found myself enjoying it a lot like what he said. </p>\n<p>I also have seen somewhat a different flow of aura in the range, somewhat how a lot of alpha men are interacting. These set of people are sharpshooters as Cayman Islands is no. 1 in the Caribean Region for competitive shooting. I just tend to reflect on Dr. Peterson’s lecture on how alpha men thinks and acts. This I get to understand that less and less people get to meet this kinds of people, mediocrity coming arising from it. The average person will just live life without experiencing the best possible opportunities and failure one can get. </p>\n<p>Life allows you to hit or miss on a lot of different opportunities that we take - given that we take it. Moreover, the meaning of life is found by gathering responsibility on those situations, layering a foundation of stories worth telling to your kids and grand children in years to come.. </p>\n<p>PS. This is my 100th blog in this platform (well its a combination of these platforms: github, react, gatsby, node and markdown) and looking forward to 1000+ more.</p>","excerpt":"Notes on my first attendance in the gun range…and my 100th blog..
