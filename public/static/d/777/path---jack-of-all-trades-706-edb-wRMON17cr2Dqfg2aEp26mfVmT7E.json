My coding skills are average, enough to debug open source codes that I like. My grammar is not that good compared to people who can really write well and  I haphazardly put myself into mediocrity as I almost got hit by a car a while ago. But of all the things I could do, one thing I am extremely sure that I’m very good at is approach a problem as truthful  and deep as possible. </p>\n<p>What do I mean by truthful and deep? Let me expand on this.</p>\n<p>My fascination for a lot of scientific subsets like physics, neuroscience and computer science have gave me an edge over the average person. I see things in how our human mind works while factoring the physical boundaries of a certain problem while also applying binary logic to it. This process goes deep sometimes. I’ll give an example. Climate change have baffled me from my stint in Palawan as garbage was all over the string of islands of Linapacan during the months of June to September. Undertstanding this problems needs a fair amount of technical knowledge as </p>","excerpt":"Thanks to Sir Jonathan for giving me an inspiration to write this complex topic.\n Okay, to start the point of our discussion was the few…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/creating-art/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Jack of all trades","tags":["creating-art","blog"],"date":"August 04, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/jack-of-all-trades/"}}
