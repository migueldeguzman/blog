I thought I was okay.</p>\n<p>Why? I have a great run! I did all the things I want whenever I want it while I’m trying to stay truthful to myself and the people I interact with. I have traveled so much in my life, helped people in need. No regrets at all. </p>\n<p>I did a lot of mistakes along the way and I have wronged people in the process, helped a corrupt presidential family to keep destroying a nation and lied quite a bit. I’m no saint, there are things that I have been involved and I will never be proud of those times..ever.</p>\n<p>I did the best life ever that I could, it was a good 33 years run. I bakpacked Thailand-Vietnam-Malaysia &#x26; Philippines and met the most amazing people. Most people from my country could’nt afford what I have done and for that I’m so grateful of the the opportunities that rain on me time and time again.</p>\n<p>I have crashed and burn after Navotac. A drastic shift in my paradigm occured as I became more inclined into learning more about how our human mind works as I have tasted true maelovence in this chapter of my life and refocused my views on living as educated and truthful as possible.</p>\n<p>I have been blessed along the way to meet people from the interweb and including words of advice from great philosphers - alive and dead. I deep dive into the science of everything, </p>\n<p>Now I’m sure I would like to live… because I want to meet you. This I believe is the only remaining chase I’m striving for..to find you and build a future with you. If I were to die tomorrow, I would be fucking pissed of fate as We never got the chance.</p>","excerpt":"\n I have reflected a lot for quite a while on what I can say to you as of the moment, I hope you would hear me out.
