Yet a detailed construct of how people’s brain work kind of makes me a perfectionist in a way because every emotion and interaction that I absorb in any situation… surely I have an explanation for it. Rarely that I do not. Considering this frame of thinking, I sound crazy. Maybe it’s just that I hated wasting time and focus it to fruitful pursuits like finding “the” person. Like killing a werewolf with a silver bullet - the answer to the question that I have been trying to decode for the past two or three years.</p>\n<p>I met someone that can understand me or rather tries to understand what I’m up to in the past three years. Most of the research I do (the narrative of this blog) and the projects I tinker are so profound that I often become singled out by mediocrity at large while trying to dispense out my uttered words or written code, trying to bring down a lot of the significant narrative that made the modern world peaceful and orderly in the past 70 years. Her perspectives on my views are framed in a different culture and set of experiences - but we get parallel still as we try to disect the truth of the topics we have touched so far.</p>\n<p>The truth cuts through. It cuts us even when we tell lies. We bleed yet the bleeding causes us to understand that the complexity of knowledge is best articulated in questioning the very foundations of our ways of belief and sharing them with others.</p>\n<p>I’m very thankful of your time Zeiya. Trying to unpack my crazy thoughts with your open mind was very helpful in my formulation of how to interact with the world. I’m sure in this process we are both discovering ourselves and a bit of the path moving forward. I’m very grateful of each nanosecond spent by your briliant heart and mind..</p>\n<p>I’m looking forward to seeing your significant works shine through your students, make them better stewards of the future..keep pushing forward Zeiya. </p>","excerpt":"  I don’t know if you’ll like reading this Zeiya! ^_^ Discovering the deeper vines that engulf our lives is overly beneficial and have paved…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/people/","/tags/creating-art/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Zeiya","tags":["people","creating-art","blog"],"date":"December 19, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/zeiya/"}}
