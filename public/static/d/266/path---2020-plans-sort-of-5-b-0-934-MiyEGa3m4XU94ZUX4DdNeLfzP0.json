Well this blog should cover for my focus on 2020. </p>\n<p>I think I’ve covered this on my reflections on 2019, but yeah… an overarching plan for the year should constantly creep my thoughts so I could fully check on myself every now and then especially when I’m moving in seemingly good paths where fatal flaws stay hidden. Well, let’s write some ideas for 2020:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A stronger upper body frame especially improving my back muscles, even thought the flexibility routine that I used for a year to fix my scoliosis have seem to work, I believe improvement in these areas are still warranted for the long run.</li>\n<li>Better mix of diet, infuse more variety of minerals and vitamins to my ketogenic diet as chasing to learn more code, basic math and art is to energy intensive not to mention the physical toll of cycling, calisthenics. (I forgot to add here that I have a day job as well. If I’m not adapted to the ketogenic lifestyle, ow man I do not know where will I get the energy to stay productive and responsible..)</li>\n<li>I was reading an algebra book yesterday and now I recognize that I should view any kind of math as a pattern recognition mechanism. Let’s see where will this book lead me…</li>\n<li>Journaling daily, a physical notebook I recycled from the office…forcing me to exercise the ancient art of writing while adding some doodles too. </li>\n<li>More art as I need to improve on the muscular dexterity of weilding a pen or digital pen.  </li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Kicking of the first day of the year to plan the year itself..
