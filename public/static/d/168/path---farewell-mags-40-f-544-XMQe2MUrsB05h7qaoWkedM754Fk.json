I got knocked of by Mags’s passing, He really caused a spin of flashbacks in my thoughts today. As a walking sponge of emotions where  the constant tirade of chats to my friends in the Philippines and a phone call to Indonesia made me absorb various surge of emotions and realizations from his passing, reflections on what to make of the event that we all are just experiencing.</p>\n<p>I reflect on death every single day. Cycling in Cayman Islands is extremely dangerous as explained by the locals, which was validated to a lot of my close encounters, almost being hit. I just credit my fast reflexes and thinking to react quickly. I adapted my body now after doing it daily for seven and a half months now, the muscles I buildthat react synchronously as needed when the limbic system kicks in with adrenaline is somewhat very reliable. But yeah, danger still lurks as when on the road, one can get blindsided. Physics is really real when your out with a driving community that is very untrustworthy and especially that getting drunk is so easy to do in the island. The things we cannot control.</p>\n<p>Yes. The things we cannot control, especially death. We are just on a finite timeline incapable of extending it. It is one of the absolute truths of this world, but even though most are afraid of accepting this very fact. I do understand the fear, but I guess we are limited in the decisions that we take all the time if we fail to realize the importance of finite time - a very limited resource that we spend, </p>","excerpt":"  You will be missed Mags..
