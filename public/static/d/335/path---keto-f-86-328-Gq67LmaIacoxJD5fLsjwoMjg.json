So why I’m on Keto..? It’s because of three sets of topics namely: sugar, evolutionary science and benefits.</p>\n<p>Sugar. Almost everything has sugar nowadays and its hilarious what we have made society so vulnerable to the taste of it. I had numerously told in various blogs / vlogs how sugar is causing obesity and diabetes but I haven’t really explained the science behind it. Caveat: I’m not a medical personnel and take my advice with precaution. My goals in sharing my thoughts about Keto is to share knowledge that I have applied in my ownself. </p>\n<p>//sugar science / insulin / obesity</p>\n<p>Evolution. Our species branched out from a common ancestral line as the bonobos 200,000 years ago. From that point, we started to learn organized hunting, eating bone marrow and mastering the art of fire until we discovered organized farming 12,000 years ago. Doing the math: 12,000 / 200,000 = .06 or 6%. What does this equation mean? it means that for 94% of the time, we have been consuming fats and meat through hunting and foraging. There are also earlier discoveries of our species where in we have been categorized as smashing mamoth bones - for bone marrow as it is also believed that this caused our neurocortex to be more developed than most species.</p>","excerpt":"Well to kickstart the series of my progress on the ketogenic diet…I’ll maybe be focusing on why I’m doing it because I realy haven’t…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/creating-art/","/tags/health-fitness/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Keto - four months in..","tags":["creating-art","health & fitness","blog"],"date":"August 08, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/keto/"}}
