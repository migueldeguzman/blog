I’m just so fascinated of the capabilities of our brain and how evolution worked for eons to create us and we clearly started from apes. The field of primatology paved way for a lot of scientists and researchers to study how pre-human nature works and gave us a better understanding of topics like infanticide, aggression, maternal instincts and sexual preferrences.</em> </p>\n<p><img src=\"robertsapolsky.jpg\" alt=\"robertsapolsky\"></p>\n<p><em>Dr. Robert Sapolsky’s book “Behave” is so fundamental in my understanding of filtering what is good and bad as we are wired of so much neural networks where it is rather becoming difficult to say that we are all making decisions as a cause of free will. A highly recommended book!</em></p>\n<p><em>He’s one of the most fascinating persons I’ve come across with in the field of biology especially primatology. He’s lecture on the topic is bloody on point as he explains how our so called human nature came to reality in great detail. I’m just on lecture 3 of 25 and I’m in awe of the depth of progress that we have accomplished in the field. I still need to turn them though to audiobooks so I can consume them while cycling and at work - whenever there will be downtime.

Even though natural selection is inaccurate at most, it developed certain conditions for our species to dominate in the present.</em></p>","excerpt":"Screaming Biology!
