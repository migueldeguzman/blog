And more and more I dived in this philosophy through Ryan Holiday, Marcus Aurelius and bits from Seneca and Epictetus. Stoicism is a foundational frame of thinking that I carry to almost any situation.</p>\n<p>One of life’s modern struggles is the tremendous number of activities that you need to handle with those who doesn’t approach life the same way. You can really see it in people’s faces that they either are confused or disoriented from the words I say, especially when it is well grounded in strict philosophy.</p>\n<p>No one can evade pain, hurt, sadness, fatigue, hunger, aging, illnesses, etc. etc. Being human is the necessity to accept and endure suffering. Unfortunately, most people are not fully aware of this conceptual framework…the average person that I normally encounter are more focused on their phones than themselves, social media addicts, brains being squeezed by codes written by the guys working in Silicon Valley.  </p>\n<p>Happiness? Being happy alwways or dealing life with excessive optimism is a form of suffering too.. as no growth will happen in a always zero recogniton of negativity. I often interact with this kinds of people who stops themselves from making a 360 degree analysis of a situation, focusing only on the good and not realizing the bad. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson claims that this types of people are often always victims of those who more harm with others than good.</p>\n<p>Life is suffering and this is one meta-truth that our consciousness have enabled us to experience. </p>","excerpt":"  A description of the struggles of applying stoic philosophy in modern social interactions…   I have been developing my stoic practices for…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/creating-art/","/tags/philosophy/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ascetic","tags":["creating-art","philosophy","blog"],"date":"October 10, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/ascetic/"}}
