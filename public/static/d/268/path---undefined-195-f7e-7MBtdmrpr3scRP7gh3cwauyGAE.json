I got knocked of by Mags’s passing, He really caused a spin of flashbacks in my thoughts today. As a walking sponge of emotions where  the constant tirade of chats to my friends in the Philippines and a phone call to Indonesia made me absorb various surge of emotions and realizations from his passing, reflections on what to make of the feelings we are experiencing.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I reflect on death every single day. Cycling in Cayman Islands is extremely dangerous as explained by the locals whom I get to encounter, which was validated to a lot of my close calls, some almost being hit. I just credit my fast reflexes and thinking that enables me to react quickly. I am more adapted now after riding the bicycle for seven and a half months now, the muscles I built that respond synchronously as needed, when the limbic system kicks in with adrenaline is somewhat very reliable. But yeah, danger still lurks as when on the road, one can get blindsided. Physics is really real when your out with a driving community that is very untrustworthy and especially that getting drunk is so easy to do in the island. The things we cannot control.</p>\n<p>Yes. The things we cannot control, especially death. We are just on a finite timeline incapable of extending it. It is one of the absolute truths of this world, but even though most are afraid of accepting this very fact. I do understand the fear around it but I guess we are limited in the decisions that we take all the time. I really believe that failing to understand the importance of finite time - we tend to be very limited in the decisions that we take, making us more vulnerable to stupidity and misery. I’ve gotten lazier than normal since my birthday last September but Mags woke my senses up again today. Us still walking on the face of the planet have no reason to complain that we cannot do anything good because WE ARE STILL BREATHING!!!! </p>\n<p>I have no right to complain from the perspective that I’m still breathing…and Mags aint anymore.</p>\n<p>He died while sleeping, gripped by a heart attack. One of the best ways to die, less pain to himself and the people he left.. compared to a terminal illness or being confined in a hospital after surviving an accident. My condolences to his family back home. I will personally miss him and our never ending tirades of philosophical discussions. I will constantly be reminded of how lucky we are in this world for we could still see the sunlight, the night sky and the stars. We could still love and hate, we can still cry and buy ice cream. Even the simple things are grand when I put it in your perspective while you are sleeping Mags. I will treasure this gift of breath that we still hold. You will definitely be missed pare. Paalam kaibigan (Goodbye my friend). </p>\n</br>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmCbPPJi5jo\">Initial thoughts after hearing the saddest news of this year..</a></p>","excerpt":"  You will be missed Mags..
