After receiving my invitation to the cissa.ky gun membership club, I’ve been readying myself for the intro seminar. Watching a lot of tutorials and using this  blog as a way to remember the gun parts I needed to focus on especially the degree of discipline needed to carry oneself through the journey of mastering the craft is extremely high, I have never encountered a skill mastery so strict as recreational shooting. </p>\n<p>Mr. Joey’s stories really reinforces the idea that mastery of the craft of shooting is freaking hard - as it takes a certain understanding of physics because of gun recoil and the bigological factor that one should practice enough to gain tremendous muscle memory to control the gun everytime a shot has been taken. I see Mr. Joey’s arm shaking after an hour of session as all the stress and adrenaline rush flow through him as he try to manuever himself in the times I saw him compete locally in the range, he is actually one of the best shooters in the club which is inspiring as well.</p>\n<p>As to my lifelong commitment to the opportunity to learn skills, the invitation should be met with enough preparation, knowledge and unmatched self-responsibility and discipline. I’m ever ready for this kinds of challenges as this is why we live for, the sacrifices to making life meaningful!</p>","excerpt":"  This 1911 9mm pistol is the most used handgun of all time in American history… A quick blog!
