A bicycle that I bought from Ms. Lois for CI$ 75 last April. Costs I have incurred to fix, maintain and improve Red are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 tires at CI$ 16.75 each</li>\n<li>2 Pumps at approx CI$ 26~</li>\n<li>Waterproof Sits for CI$ 16~</li>\n<li>2 inner tubes for CI$ 4.75 each</li>\n<li>WD-40 for approx. CI$ 20~</li>\n<li>Metal Basket for bringing stuff - CI$ 22~</li>\n<li>Tools approx. CI$ 30~</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Total Cost of my almost athlete heart: CI$ 232~</b></p>\n<br/>\n<p>How I achieved a great milestone for just merely spending so little? the discipline should be emphatic - definitive and insane levels. The daily routine goes like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to wake up 4AM to 4:30AM</li>\n<li>Meditate 15 mins to 1 hr; Try to do calisthenics after recovery / rest..</li>\n<li>Prep for 30 mins to work - the usual stuff</li>\n<li>Go cycling 5:30AM - 5:45AM..(7.2 Kms..)</li>\n<li>Work extremely well from 6:45AM to 4:45PM; try to squeeze a blog and art all after lunch..</li>\n<li>5PM cycle back home (7.2 Kms..)</li>\n<li>Buy supplies and / or Prep food (keto) dinner and the ff day’s lunch.. normally 6PM..and eventual dinner.. </li>\n<li>Complete partial blog / art, code / study JavaScript and other topics of interest -normally through youtube and podcasts after dinner. Occasional Mobile Gaming..</li>\n<li>8PM to 9PM sleeptime</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see from my abbreviated list of things that I do everyday - there is no downtime except for sleep. This schedule will drive an average person mad. Well it worked out for me that is why I would recommend this routine to everybody who’s wanting to create a healthy lifestyle. </p>\n<p>Integrating a life long passion for at the very least an aerobic exercise will greatly enhance your life, relationships (sex life, transferring healthy genes) and career (better cognitive abilities). I hope anyone who gets to read this post should study what I have written here very carefully, as I would argue that this is one of my best articles ever written.  </p>","excerpt":"Screaming Biology!!!.. *Science is so dense, been doing a lot of deep dive learning human behavior biology and personality traits * This is…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/creating-art/","/tags/biology/","/tags/psychology/","/tags/philosophy/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Primatology","tags":["creating-art","biology","psychology","philosophy","blog"],"date":"August 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/primatology/"}}
