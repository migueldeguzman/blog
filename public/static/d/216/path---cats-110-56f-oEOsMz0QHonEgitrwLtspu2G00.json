They will play only when they want to, sleep beside you if they feel cold. </p>\n<p>Dogs are much more obedient than cats. It is easier to predict their responses to what you are telling them. Cats most of the time I just scratch my head.</p>\n<p>We do have a dog and eleven cats in a very small house. In some sense it makes our house feel a lot bigger because there is always activity happening all around because of our pets. My nanay (mom) loves them like her own children. </p>\n<p>There’s one cat who always sleep with me in the bed when the weather is cold. His name is “Teme”.</p>\n<p>Teme have taught me a lot of stuff. Co-existence is one, he likes to sleep and most of the time I sleep more because of him, because waking up early disturbs his. </p>\n<p>I remember a lesson Dr. Jordan Peterson explains in his book the 12 rules for life. It is “Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street”.
