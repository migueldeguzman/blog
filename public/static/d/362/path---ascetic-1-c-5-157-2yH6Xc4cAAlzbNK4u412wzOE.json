Scavenging the works of Tim Ferris and Ryan Holiday plus the greek accounts about the life of Marcus Aurelius and bits from Seneca and Epictetus have taken me to a tricky position in most of my social interactions. Stoicism is a foundational frame of thinking yet it really will challenge one who dares to apply it in the modern world. Yes, I did say that I seem invincible through accepting that what I could control is only myself and my response to others’ actions…yet the underlying detail of the before mentioned logic turns every part of my world almost sideways - especially as the average person I encounter even in here in the western world interprets it the other way almost always most of the time. </p>\n<p>The tremendous number of activities that you need to handle with those who doesn’t approach life is so immense. You can really see it in people’s faces that they either they are confused or disoriented from the words I say, especially when it is well grounded in strict philosophy. The only solution I bet on is always trying to tell the truth, while trying to listen to the voices of all and expressions of the silent gestures of the single or the crowd. I’m yet very early in my psychological understanding of the world but it is becoming a tool of my trade in discerning really raw and tough situations. </p>\n<p>A stoic approaches any situation as competent and adaptive as possible while lending all possible ears, eyes and feelings available. It is so energy intensive so I exercising and eating the right way crucial.</p>\n<p>No one can evade pain, hurt, sadness, fatigue, hunger, aging, illnesses, etc. etc. Being human is the necessity to accept and endure suffering. Unfortunately, most people are not fully aware of this conceptual framework…the average person that I normally encounter are more focused on their phones than themselves, social media addicts, brains being squeezed by codes written by the guys working in Silicon Valley.  </p>\n<p>Happiness? Being happy alwways or dealing life with excessive optimism is a form of suffering too.. as no growth will happen in a always zero recogniton of negativity. I often interact with this kinds of people who stops themselves from making a 360 degree analysis of a situation, focusing only on the good and not realizing the bad. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson claims that this types of people are often always victims of those who more harm with others than good.</p>\n<p>Taking responsibility for my own actions is at the core of stoicism and my daily struggles. Most of the time my intuitive nature of managing tasks becomes a talking point with most of my colleagues -normall. My personality as an extrovert instinctively kicks in most of the time, as I try to dig the depths of my ability to communicate just to convey my message to most of them. Why I often use my time like this? It is a well grounded concept in science that social interactions weave better brain connections, if one decides on investing the time alloted to explain stuff in a very unorganized way, the effects of it could be massive that it either create the worst kinds of responses and it is </p>\n<p>Life is suffering and this is one meta-truth that our consciousness have enabled us to experience. </p>","excerpt":"  Stoic life in the modern world… I have been developing my stoic practices for maybe roughly three years now and just this year was I…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/creating-art/","/tags/philosophy/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ascetic","tags":["creating-art","philosophy","blog"],"date":"October 10, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/ascetic/"}}
