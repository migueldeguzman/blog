The crazy thing is we do not know how our brain utilizes information. This truth made me visualize a lot as I do know how computers record stuff and translates them. The big difference is the amount of electricity that runs into a computing machine compared to us. Our is just very low energy and that makes our neurons so bloody fascinating.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deep time - Technically we could measure this but we are unable to comprehend the abusrdity of time if taken into account from the birth of the universe to the far future. It’s immense amount of uncertainty and entanglement to tons of information and I have no words to put to it..</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Butterfly Effect - What ever seemingly unimportant tweak in our decision takes us in to a far more different outcome that we are incapable of predicting. What is weird is we can see a pattern of it as simulated by researchers showing an image of a butterfly. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The future of artificial intelligence - We are in a transition point of how computing power of machines are increasing </p>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"  There is so much that we can measure and so much that we cannot…below are some of the topics I’ve came across in the past year or so that…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/technology/","/tags/physics/","/tags/history/","/tags/volunteering/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Absurd math","tags":["technology","physics","history","volunteering","blog"],"date":"December 08, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/absurd-math/"}}
