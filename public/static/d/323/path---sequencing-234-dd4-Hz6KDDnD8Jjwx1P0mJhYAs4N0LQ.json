There is a big getting used to track thing as it is very difficult to do dry run in Cayman Islands as the law prohibits the purchase guns and even of airsoft guns. Yeah I know that it takes time learn especially precision shooting but yeah I’m taking more focus to watch more training videos and do alot of practices in the range. I rattled out because my body is not in sync with the proper reload demo and how to reposition the arm after the reload. That is key to making a great result to doing drills in the range. Well I just have to deploy focus and a lot of patience to get things going. </p>\n<p>Sequencing is a good thing to analyze when you try to check on how one’s autonomous actions playout in their responses. Like what I did in the timed de-facto black badge drill - I shot well for a newbie in the first circle but lost the next circles because I do not know how to reload properly and my quickness in my actions caused my brain to stop thinking properly. Mr. Joey is telling me I’m shooting too fast. I honestly do not see that I’m shooting fast. I can review in my mind each mistake and reload. Well, perks of doing the triad of meditation, ketogenic diet and exercising.</p>","excerpt":"I rattled out while trying how alpha males do it in the gun range..
