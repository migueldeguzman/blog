Rare nutrients are essential to my ketogenic journey as I try to build a better cognitive base layer for the tons of information that I want to make sense in the coming months, including the projects that I’m looking to deep dive in especially those related to tackling the climate change.</p>\n<p>I was discussing with my colleague Sandra that I really feel that everyday that I do not have much time that is why I’m trying to do more from what I have now.

Most just suffer through life with either endless pleasure or endless cortisol jolts from social media or traditional news.</p>\n<p>Six months in, this has been a powerful sacrifice…paying off exponentially through my increase capacity to do more and absorb more. I hope people who will be able to read this may get to evaluate themselves and their loveones with regards to health concerns. Biology have saved me numerous times and the ability understand and connect diet with genetics will be instrumental in connecting now into future and beyond…</p>","excerpt":"I’m trying supplements..haven’t seen the effects yet..
