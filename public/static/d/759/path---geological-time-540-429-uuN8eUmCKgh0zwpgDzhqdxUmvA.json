Though I wanted to live longer than 39 years, well it is rather very difficult to compete with my own biological clock. Now to view things differently, let’s acknowledge not the lifespan but deterioration of these items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plastics - 100 years to 500 years</li>\n<li>Smartphones</li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And who am I to question the magnificent structure of the universe. Very grateful to even have the ability to write blogs and make sense of the experience living in it.</p>","excerpt":"I’m kind of obsessed on how to maximize time the little time I have in my life…moreover gone across the depths of science and the universe…","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/philosophy/","/tags/physics/","/tags/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Geological time","tags":["philosophy","physics","blog"],"date":"December 24, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/geological-time/"}}
